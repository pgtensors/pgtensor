# pgtensor
pgtensor: Open-source tensor storage for Postgres, intended to be compatible with pgvector. Designed with quantum computing in mind, where vectors could represent quantum states and tensors describe composite quantum states. This project also extends to advanced data research applications, including machine learning and scientific computing.
